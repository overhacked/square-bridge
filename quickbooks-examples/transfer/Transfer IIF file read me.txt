		THE INCLUDED IIF FILE IS BEST VIEWED IN MICROSOFT EXCEL

This IIF file is designed to allow you to import a Transfer into a new QuickBooks data file.
At the top of the file you will see the account information needed if the accounts are not 
already set up.  By specifying them first in the file we set them up on the correct list so 
the transaction cannot get it wrong.  If the accounts are already set up, then you can 
remove that part of the file.

The bottom part of the file, from !trns to endtrns, is the set up for the actual Transfer 
transaction. 

An IIF file has a header line that explains to QuickBooks what information it is going to 
be seeing next.  All header lines begin with an exclamation point.  This file contains the 
header lines needed to import to the chart of accounts and a Transfer transaction.  Some 
columns may not have anything in them and that is fine, however, the headers and columns 
need to be there for QuickBooks to be able to import it correctly.  Just leave them blank if
you do not have anything that goes in that field.

		THE INCLUDED IIF FILE IS BEST VIEWED IN MICROSOFT EXCEL

This IIF file is designed to allow you to import a General Journal into a new QuickBooks 
data file.  At the top of the file you will see the account information needed if the 
accounts are not already set up.  Next will be the class if applicable, followed by customer,
vendor, and other names.  These are needed in order for the lists to be set up properly.  By
default an unspecified item will import as a service item.  A customer name attached to the 
spl line of a General Journal transaction will import to the vendor list and the vendor name
attached to the trns line of a General Journal transaction will import to the other names 
list unless the names are already on the correct lists.  By specifying them first in the 
file we set them up on the correct list so the transaction cannot get it wrong.  If the 
accounts, classes, customers, vendors, and/or other names are already set up, then you can 
remove that part of the file.

The bottom part of the file, from !trns to endtrns, is the set up for the actual General 
Journal transaction. 

An IIF file has a header line that explains to QuickBooks what information it is going to 
be seeing next.  All header lines begin with an exclamation point.  This file contains the 
header lines needed to import to the chart of accounts, class list, customer list, vendor 
list, other names list and a General Journal transaction.  Some columns may not have 
anything in them and that is fine, however, the headers and columns need to be there for 
QuickBooks to be able to import it correctly.  Just leave them blank if you do not have 
anything that goes in that field.
